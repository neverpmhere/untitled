      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p className="typing-text">The experience system is designed so that players earn experience exclusively by performing various actions. 
      This system is similar to the one used in Skyrim, where every action directly contributes to the development of the character's skills.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">When a player performs certain actions, such as fighting enemies, crafting, gathering resources, or completing quests, 
      they earn experience in the corresponding skills. For example, using weapons increases combat skills, while potion-making increases alchemy skills. 
      The more time and effort a player invests in specific actions, the more experience they gain and the higher their skill levels become.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">The system also allows for the acquisition of additional skills and perks. As players develop their skills, 
      they can unlock special abilities or improvements that make their characters more effective and versatile. These skills and perks can include increasing damage in combat, 
      boosting attack speed, or reducing the time required to defend against or dodge an attack.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Thus, the experience system encourages active participation and variety in actions, 
      allowing players to develop their characters according to their playstyle and preferences. This makes the experience system more engaging and deeply personalized, 
      encouraging players to continuously develop and explore new possibilities.</p>
