      <h2>The Science</h2>
      <p className="typing-text">The world players immerse themselves in is full of amazing features that make it unique and exciting to explore. 
      This world operates under its own physical and chemical laws, which opens up limitless possibilities for scientific research and discovery.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">The cause of some phenomena remains a mystery, 
      and this will be a stimulus for players to conduct their own research and experiments to uncover the secrets of this world. 
      Players can devote their time to various sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology, and geology to understand and explain the nature of these anomalies.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Research in the field of chemistry can help uncover the mysteries of substance reactions under the planet's conditions, 
      while physics can explain unusual phenomena related to gravity or electromagnetic fields. 
      The world itself actively encourages players to engage in science and research by offering many puzzles and phenomena that need to be solved. 
      Studying these phenomena not only helps to expand knowledge about the environment but also opens up new opportunities for utilizing the planet's resources.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">In this world, 
      every discovery can lead to significant breakthroughs that change the ways of interacting with the environment and allow the use of its unique properties to one's advantage. 
      For example, understanding the reasons why gunpowder does not burn, but diamond dust does, could lead to the creation of new types of fuel or energy sources.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Thus, the unique physical and chemical rules of the world make it especially interesting for research. 
      Every player can find their niche in studying this amazing world and contribute to understanding its secrets and possibilities.</p>
