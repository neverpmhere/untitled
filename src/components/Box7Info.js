      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p className="typing-text">Each player sets their own goals for what they want to achieve in this world. Some aim to leave a legacy, 
      while others prefer to remain anonymous. Maybe someone wants to earn money without delving deeply into the world's intricacies, 
      while another dreams of becoming a great trade route manager with caravans spanning the entire continent. Others might want to form a team that will rob those caravans.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Your goals are limited only by your imagination. You can become a musician in a local city cabaret or a poet known across the continent. 
      Perhaps you want to be a warrior defending the city from human vices and local fauna, or a scientist studying the properties of plants and resources.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Each choice opens up new opportunities and paths for development. You can pursue your dreams and ambitions, 
      creating a unique story and leaving your mark on this world. No matter which path you choose, 
      the world offers endless possibilities for self-expression and achieving your set goals.</p>
