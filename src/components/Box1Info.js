      <h2>NPCs</h2>
      <p className="typing-text">NPCs respond to player actions naturally, changing their behavior based on interactions. 
      They don't just follow pre-written scripts but truly understand and learn from their actions and interactions (AGI).
      Ð¡haracters can adapt to various circumstances, whether it's combat, diplomatic negotiations, or everyday tasks, 
      making each gaming experience unique and unpredictable.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Characters can create music, poetry, and even express human emotions, allowing players to feel part of a living, breathing world. 
      For example, you might meet a woodworker who crafts furniture from materials you gathered during adventures, or a weaver who remembers your preferences in fabrics and colors, 
      offering goods that match your tastes. This enriches the gameplay, adding depth and realism, and making it more engaging and dynamic. 
      You may also encounter a cook who remembers your favorite dishes and prepares them just for you, or a trader who helps you find rare and valuable items for your quests.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">AGI allows characters to develop their own stories and goals, creating complex networks of relationships and motivations. 
      For instance, a mercenary might start as a simple soldier but eventually develop their skills and become a leader of a group ready to assist you in difficult times. 
      A farmer could expand their holdings, create a thriving farm, and start supplying you with food and rare ingredients for potions.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Different parts of the world have their own customs and cultures, adding diversity and depth. 
      For example, residents of one region might have entirely different customs and traditions than those of another. 
      These differences can influence their behavior and interactions with players. 
      Characters might even attack players due to a previous negative encounter or because of their beliefs and cultural differences.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">The gameplay offers not just entertainment but a deep, multi-layered experience where every player and character contributes their unique part. 
      Your actions matter, and interacting with others leaves an indelible mark on your story. 
      An ethical approach to many characters will be rewarded; they might share food, equipment, or other valuables as a sign of gratitude or assistance.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Adding these elements creates a more realistic and engaging gaming environment, 
      where every player can feel like an important part of a vast and complex world. 
      Your actions and decisions will significantly impact the gameplay, making each session unique and memorable.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Additionally, the world lives its own life independently of the player. Political intrigues, economic changes, 
      or natural disasters can affect the lives of characters and their behavior, adding an extra layer of complexity and realism. 
      Players can interact with these events, helping or hindering others, creating many possible outcomes and paths for the story's development.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">The gaming environment offers active participation in creating and developing a unique and dynamic story, 
      where every character and player contributes to the overall development of the game's world, its mechanics, and its sciences. 
      With a large open world, a variety of characters, and mechanics, the gameplay will inspire players for a long time, 
      encouraging them to develop not only the stories of other characters and possibly even settlements but also strive to improve their own skills, 
      helping to shape the future of the world.</p>
