      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p className="typing-text">Every player can freely travel across a vast map consisting of thousands of villages, hundreds of towns and castles, 
      as well as dozens of huge cities, often referred to as capitals. The entire world, or rather the planet, is a single continent that players are tasked with exploring. 
      They can protect and develop villages with their guild, supply caravans to neighboring settlements, sell their crops or other necessary items there, 
      and make requests to purchase specific resources.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">The world is so vast that even after thousands of hours of gameplay, there will still be places where no player's foot has stepped. 
      The terrain generation and restoration are managed by a dedicated AI, which also oversees the physical, chemical, historical, and biological properties of the world. 
      This ensures that all processes remain at a level of realistic environment where every corner of the continent is unique and interesting to explore.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Players can explore diverse landscapes, including dense forests, endless deserts, towering mountains, and vast plains, 
      and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Each area of the world has its own unique cultural and social characteristics, making every journey new and exciting. 
      You can follow roads trodden by other players or blaze your own trail in the wilderness. The more players travel through a certain place, the more visible the path becomes, 
      similar to the roads in Death Stranding.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Everyone can freely travel to any point in the world, with the only limitation being that teleportation is not provided, 
      so all routes must be manually navigated by players. However, along the way, they can always get distracted and find treasures that will help in leveling up their character.</p>
