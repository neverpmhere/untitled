      <h2>Level System</h2>
      <p className="typing-text">Every player starts at level 0, and the maximum level that can be reached is 100. Experience points increase through performing specific actions. 
      For example, to become a top-notch farmer, one must level up their farming skill, and to become an excellent cook, one must level up their cooking skill. 
      Each level has its own experience bar, and all skills require the same amount of total experience to level up.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Currently, the main advantage of leveling up is obtaining rare skills. These rare skills can significantly enhance gameplay, 
      such as improving the quality of handcrafted items or reducing their creation cost. If you already have one of these skills, 
      additional skills can be obtained as rewards for participating in game events.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Leveling up and developing skills provide players with an incentive to improve their characters, making their builds significantly stronger. 
      This not only increases the player's personal capabilities but also raises their value within a guild. A strong and experienced character can become a key asset for a guild, 
      contributing to its success and influence.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Additionally, the best players will receive rewards, which further motivates them to achieve more. 
      This reward system acknowledges and encourages the efforts of top players, ensuring their dedication and skills are recognized. 
      For the highest-level players, there is also a mentorship system that allows them to help new players level up faster, earning additional bonuses in return. 
      Furthermore, as players level up, they receive passive bonuses, such as increased health or faster resource recovery.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">The best players also have the opportunity to create personal skills, which can be tailored to their play style and needs. 
      This adds uniqueness and strategic depth to character development. Thus, the leveling and skill system allows players to develop their abilities and gain unique advantages.</p>
