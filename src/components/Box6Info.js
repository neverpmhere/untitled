      <h2>Blockchain & Trade</h2>
      <p className="typing-text">Blockchain integration in the system allows users to exchange their items and track data about them. 
      This convenient system provides players with the ability to trade in-game assets safely and transparently.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Using blockchain technology, each item in the system receives a unique digital identifier, which is recorded in an immutable ledger. 
      This allows for precise tracking of each item's ownership and exchange history. Players can be confident in the authenticity and origin of their assets.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Item exchanges occur through an integrated trading platform, which ensures the security of transactions and ease of use. 
      The platform allows items to be transferred and payments received safely, without the need for intermediaries.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Additionally, the blockchain system includes various tags that can be applied to items. For example, if an item was stolen using skills, 
      it will be tagged with a special marker. There are skills that allow players to remove such tags. However, if an item was stolen through hacking or scamming, 
      the tag can only be removed by the person who placed it.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">These tags help prevent the illegal use and trade of stolen items, providing an additional level of security and fairness within the system. 
      Players can see the status and history of an item, which fosters trust among participants and encourages active trading.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Blockchain integration also allows for the creation of limited-edition items that can become especially valuable to collectors. 
      These unique items can be sold or exchanged in the market, adding a new level of depth and strategy to the gameplay. Players can also create and sell unique decor, 
      adding personality to their game spaces and offering new ways for other players to personalize their environments.</p>

      <p className="typing-text">Live blockchain in-game integration opens up numerous opportunities for creating a dynamic and engaging game world. 
      It enhances the security and transparency of item exchanges, allows players to earn real money by trading their in-game assets on a global platform, 
      and includes mechanisms to prevent and manage item theft.</p>
